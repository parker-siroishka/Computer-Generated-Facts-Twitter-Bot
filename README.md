# Computer-Generated-Facts-Twitter-Bot

A Twitter application bot that utilizes Edwin Dalmaijer's Python library <em>Markovbot</em>. 

Through compiling a rather large list of random facts from online, the bot goes
through this list and tries to create grammatically correct computer generated facts.

The results are always silly and not quite what was expected.

<strong>I take no credit for the creation of the Markovbot library.</strong> I merely used it out of boredom for fun!
